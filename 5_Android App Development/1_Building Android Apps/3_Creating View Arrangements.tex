Creating View Arrangements
        Learn about common 👉Android ViewGroups👈 like 💎ConstraintLayout and 💎LinearLayout, which enable us to bring complex designs to life
            
        Isolated Views hardly warrant a user’s attention—we’ve personally never downloaded a One Line of Text In The Middle of the Screen app, but maybe that’s just us. Let’s explore how ViewGroups and the attributes they define help us arrange multiple Views into valuable designs.

        We will meet ConstraintLayout and LinearLayout, two of Android’s most well-known ViewGroups; the former arranges Views relative to other Views, and the latter arranges them in straight lines. When we use ViewGroups in tandem with Android’s cornucopia of interface components, we may form exceptionally complex designs without ever building a custom View class.

        Review:
            👉ConstraintLayout arranges its children relative to itself and other children (leftOf, rightOf, below, etc.). 
            👉LinearLayout arranges its children in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically.
            👉Children of ConstraintLayout must provide one horizontal and one vertical constraint to define their position within the ConstraintLayout.
            👉ConstraintLayout is primarily ‘bottom-up,’ as it requires its children to supply position-related attributes, whereas LinearLayout is ‘top-down’ and dictates the final position to each child.
            👉Margins introduce space between Views, and Views often benefit from the “breathing room” margins provide.

        What two things must children of ConstraintLayout provide through attributes?
            ✔️Horizontal & Vertical Constraints
            X & Y Constraints
            Top and Bottom Padding
            Top and Bottom Margin

        What type of objects are LinearLayout and ConstraintLayout?
            Layout
            ✔️ViewGroup
            Container
            Arranger

        Which type of constraint is highlighted in purple on the screenshot below?
            Top to Top of Parent
            Bottom to Bottom of View
            ✔️Top to Top of View
            Top to Bottom of View
            Left to Left of Parent
